If you've configured your ncurses with --enable-sigwinch, then you can go the easy way out, and just watch the characters that you get from getch() for a KEY_RESIZE. When ncurses handles the SIGWINCH signal, it pushes a KEY_RESIZE back onto the queue that getch() uses, so that the next call to getch() will return that value. However, not everyone's ncurses library has been configured with that switch, so relying on that behavior is not portable.
