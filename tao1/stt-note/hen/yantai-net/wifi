# wifi setup

now I have ubuntu 910 for both INSPIRON and VOSTRO, but on VOSTRO you need to enable the driver manually:

	I go to sys->admin->hardware and installed the broadcom wireless driver for my VOSTRO
	and reboot, but `iwconfig ` still give me nothing about WLan, shit!
	then I nothice there were acttually another driver avaiable there, 
	so I tried, and now I get my wireless connection through *eth2* (not Wlan0 as on INSPIRON)


## server side configration

just go to NetworkManager(NM) sys tray, click "creat new wireless network", easy.
then connect server machine itself to the connection first.

if you run `iwconfig` now you shall see the wlan interface is configured with essid and stuff...

### no need to install dhcp3-server

because for the time being the INSPIRON machine is still fresh and no dhcp3-server is installed
so maybe dnsmasq is used here to be the DHCP server. 

## client side configuration

basiclly no configuration for the client side, just click the ad-hoc connection from the server
that is all.

and on client side, `ifwconfig` shows no conf for wireless card.

when I install 9.10 on INSPIRON, the ad-hoc wireless net work I configured on VOSTRO
namely `no-crypt-peter`

all you need to do now in INSPIRON, is just one clike on no-crypt-peter

and the ip of INSPIRON is confiured to 10.1.43.10
well VOSTRO is 10.1.43.1

ssh done

	ssh peter@10.1.43.1

have a `vivion-ad-hoc` on INSPIRON, then I can ping from VOSTRO to INSPIRON as well

## NOTE:

is you need to have both machine connected to a same network
one as server and one as client. Say I created a vivion-ad-hoc connection on INSPIRON, then first I need to connect INSPIRON itself to this vivion-ad-hoc, then I switch to VOSTRO, I can find the vivion-ad-hoc, by click thetray icon, and then click to connect, the ip is got, and the connection is done. no "dhcpclient eth2" is needed.

## misc

OK, so now I can easily add a ad-hoc connection with NM, and the communication on client and server goes well.
Now what i did is to go the the server side and run "pon dsl-provider" and wait for 30 second or so, then "ping www. baidu.com" on server and clent side both done!

easy and no extra config is required, the problem is that the internect connection is not so stable, I do not know why.
But finally I can use VOSTRO to surf, when the cable is plug into INSPIRON, great!
