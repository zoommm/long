in YANTAI my wired connection is pppoe

now my pppoe is running well, I must wirte down the current look of my system

1.	the tray icon of NetworkManager shows wired connection disconnected
	A: I think this is simply because NM failed to fetch a IP for local eth0
	while actully the pppoe connection does not require that.
2.	ifconfig eth0 has no ip
3.	dhclient eth0---will fail
4.	somethimes you see "device(wired connection) not managed"
	this does not matter, try NOT to change `/etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf`
	even though it will get rid of the "not managed", but actually when you run `ppoeconf`
	you will see the WARNING about `ifup -a` disabled because of this. SO JUST DO NOTHING!


## test

now given the above state for VOSTRO, I start INSPIRON, on which a ad-hoc wireless network(named v1) is active
what happened is:

1.	the networkmanager on VOSTRO, detected v1(this takes one or two minite, no operation is required)
	and because NM thinks wired network is disconnected, so it automatically give VOSTRO to `v1`
	once this is done, ping www.baidu.com will fail

2.	want to bring wired connection back? easy! go to the NM tray icon, click to disconnect `v1`
	and do sth like 'service networking restart'&&`ifup -a`(or ocassionly `pon dsl-provider`), that is all

## tips

sometimes when you run `ifconfig` and you will find out there are more than one `ppp` interface
and the IP binding with them are different. I think it happens when I run "pon dsl-provider"  more
then once. Anyway, it does not seem to bring trouble.
