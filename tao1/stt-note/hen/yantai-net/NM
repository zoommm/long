so NetworkManger is not really friendly with my pppoe connection.
even when pppoe is up and running well, NetworkManger still believes it is disconnected.
that explains well, why when I set up a wlan, the wired connection is disabled automatically.
it is simply because NetworkManger sees wired is disconnect, so he will always try to connect to 
valid connection, thus disabled my atcully up-and-running wired connection.

## bug

the pppoe issue on 9.10 NM is a reported bug, the fix goes here:

## tip

NO.1: just now I see on NM, that "Wireless Network is disabled", I was confused at first
but soon realize it is simply because I cloased wifi with <Fn>+<F2>, the FIX is to do the same to active wifi, and it worked.
