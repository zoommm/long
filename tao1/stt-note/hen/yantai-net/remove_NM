now it is very obvious to me on ubuntu 9.10(and 9.04) if you try to config
wired and wireless connection altogether, the pppoe connection will become fairly
unstable.
My current solution is to remove NM on 9.10,  and now things are fine.
but I don't know yet  how to config a wireless connction by hand without NM

below are some I've succeeded in:

	root@vivion-laptop:~# iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc
	Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06) :
	    SET failed on device wlan0 ; Device or resource busy.
	root@vivion-laptop:~# ifdown wlan0
	ifdown: interface wlan0 not configured
	root@vivion-laptop:~# ifconfig wlan0 down
	root@vivion-laptop:~# iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc ##done afer doing ifconfig wlano down

mode managed is what you want if you are connecting to a wireless router. The channel and esidd will have to be set the same as your router.
